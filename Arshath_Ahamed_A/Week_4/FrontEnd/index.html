            <p>The Valley of Peace is an expansive mass of land located in China. The mountain-surrounded Valley hosts a varied landscape, ranging from sky-reaching mountain peaks to flat paddy field. Rivers weave through the land, dividing it into several distinct villages, communities, and farming areas. Overlooking the Valley is the Jade Palace, a residence and training ground for kung fu masters and students that is accessible by a staircase that scales the cliff.</p>
